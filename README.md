Data Visualization with Histograms - Adult Census Income Dataset
This repository contains code and resources for visualizing the distribution of categorical data using histograms in the Adult Census Income dataset. The dataset provides demographic information about individuals and their income levels.

Dataset
The Adult Census Income dataset is available here. It includes various attributes such as age, education, workclass, marital status, and more. The target variable is the income level, indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year.

Repository Contents
data/: This directory contains the Adult Census Income dataset files.
prodigy-infotech-data-science-task-1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing code and visualizations.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository.
Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/aryanjuyal37/Prodigy_Data-Science_Task-1.git

Open the prodigy-infotech-data-science-task-1.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Execute the code cells in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and create histograms for categorical variables.

Review the generated histograms and analyze the distribution of categorical data.

Results
The notebook generates histograms that visualize the distribution of categorical variables such as work-class, education, marital status, and more in the Adult Census Income dataset. The histograms provide insights into the income distribution across different categories, helping to identify trends and patterns.
